    "Specifically, we will aim to answer the question: **Can we predict whether a player subscribes to the newsletter based on their age, experience, and total hours played from the *players* dataset?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer our specific question, we have decided to use the *players* dataset. There are some issues with this dataset, namely the bias due to size and outliers. For the age and played_hours variables, there are some outlier variables, which could skew our visualizations, and mean calculation. Not to mention that some of the played_hour numbers are unrealistic; for exmaple, one player played 223 hours, which seems too extreme. There is also bias in the experience variable because it is not clear how players were split up into these experiences (like what were the characteristics used?). Additionally, there could be potential sampling bias because what if some of the data collected was not seen as \"important\" to be reported comapred to the rest."

    "#### 1. Summrize\n",
    "This project analyzed data from a Minecraft research server to predict player newsletter subscription status using age, experience, and total hours played. Exploratory analysis revealed a significant class imbalance, with 73.5% of the 196 players subscribed. Players were concentrated in the 15–25 age range, and Regular-experience players showed the highest playing time and subscription rate. A K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifier was used for prediction, and the optimal k=13 resulted in a final test accuracy of 71.4%. However, the confusion table exposed a critical flaw: the model maximized its accuracy by predicting the majority class (subscribed) almost universally, correctly identifying 35 out of 36 true subscribers but failing to learn any features to distinguish non-subscribers."

    "#### 2. Whether this is what we expected to find\n",
    "The high overall subscription rate was plausible given that the data originated from a research server where high player engagement is expected. However, the resulting performance of the k-NN model was unexpected. The moderate 71.4% accuracy was misleading because the model took advantage of the severe class imbalance, which was demonstrated by the model’s failure to correctly classify almost any true non-subscribers. This indicated the model did not genuinely learn predictive features for non-subscription, instead defaulting to the majority class prediction, which greatly reduces its practical predictive utility despite the seemingly acceptable accuracy score."

    "#### 3. Impact could have\n",
    "Although the model achieved a seemingly acceptable accuracy of 71.4%, our deeper evaluation using Cohen’s kappa and the confusion matrix indicated a severe class imbalance issue. This could lead to poor decision-making in real-world application. If identifying non-subscribers are important in making decisions or developing strategic target, the consequence of misleading will be more severe. So, without proper handling the class imbalance of data, the model will fail to provide reliable or valuable information about minority groups."
